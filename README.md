# CityPassBot
Our team, Dream Team:
Created a bot for Telegram and a website.
In Telegram, we connected ChatGPT which can respond to messages from users and provide a response.
In Telegram, there are also buttons that help retrieve up-to-date data from the database. The database is created in PostgreSQL which is hosted on a site (pythonanywhere), as well as the Telegram bot itself, so it can be used now by the nickname: @CITY_PASS_ANSTANA_BOT
There is also a website that can be run locally or visit hosted link: https://api17247.pythonanywhere.com/
